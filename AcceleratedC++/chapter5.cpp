//exercise. Note that it is possible to write a drive that differs
//only in the declaration of the type for the data struture
//that holds the input file. If your vector and list test drivers

//in this declaration.

//a picture in which all the lines of the original picture are
//padded out to their full width, and the padding is as evenly 
//divided as possible btween the left and right sides of the 
//picture. What are the properties of pictures for which such a
//function is useful? How can you tell whether a given picture
//has those properties?

//of erasing each failing student from the input vector v, it
//copies the records for the passing students to the beginning of
//v, and then uses the resize function to remove the extra elements
//from the end of v. How does performance of this version compare
//to the one in 5.1.1/77?

//vector<string> v;
//frame(v);

//describe what happens in this call. In particular trace through

//run this code. If the results differ from your expectations,
//first understand why your expectations and the program differ,
//and then change one to match the other.

//In text processing it is sometimes useful to know whether
//a word has any ascenders or descenders.Ascenders are the parts
//of lowercase letters that etend above the text line; in the
//English alphabet, the letters b, d, f, h, k, l, and t have
//ascenders. Similarly, the descenders are the parts of lowercase
//letters that descend below the line. In English, the letters
//g, j, p, q and y have descenders. Write a program to determine
//whether a word has any ascenders or descenders. Extend that
//program to find the longest word in the dictionary
//that has neither ascenders nor descenders.
